# National Construction Company - Construction Contractor Website

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for National Construction Company, a national electrical and mechanical construction contractor. The application serves as a corporate website featuring company information, services, projects, team details, and includes an AI-powered chatbot for customer inquiries. It also provides a contact form system for lead generation.

## System Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
The application uses a monorepo architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **`client/`** - React frontend with Vite build system
- **`server/`** - Express.js backend API
- **`shared/`** - Shared TypeScript types and database schema
- **Configuration files** at root level for tooling and deployment

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design system
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for chatbot functionality
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Deployment**: Configured for Replit with autoscale deployment

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React with wouter for routing
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable UI components from shadcn/ui
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **State management** using React Query for server state and React hooks for local state

### Database Design
The application uses three main tables:
- **`users`** - User authentication (currently for future admin functionality)

- **`chat_conversations`** - AI chatbot conversation history with session tracking

### UI Components
- **Navigation system** with smooth scrolling to sections

## Data Flow

5. Success/error response sent back to frontend
6. User receives confirmation message

### Chatbot Flow
1. User opens chatbot interface and sends message
2. Frontend sends message with session ID to `/api/chat` endpoint
3. Backend calls OpenAI API with system prompt and user message
4. AI response generated using GPT-4o model
5. Conversation stored in database with session tracking
6. Response sent back to frontend and displayed to user
